Piano Key Numbers (or Pitch Range Numbers) are specific numbers given to the Piano Keys so that they can be identified in a consistent and logical way. These numbers also allow us to identify the range of all Musical Instruments (including the Voice) as they relate to musical pitches.

Each musical instrument has a specific range in pitch (lowest to highest note). The piano has a range of 88 keys. It is used as the basis for numbering pitches, beginning with A0 (A zero) and B0 (B zero), followed by 7 octaves from C1 (C one) to C8 (C eight). (Middle C is C4 - C four.)
